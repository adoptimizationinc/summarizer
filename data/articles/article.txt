PandoDaily’s recent article on wage suppression in Silicon Valley highlights the lack of transparency in the employment market. Mighty Spring offers services to help people make informed career decisions and we have strong opinions about transparency in recruiting. This is a major issue: making the right choices for your career depends on solid market information. 

Professionals largely operate in their careers without solid market information, tacitly accepting this status quo. Unfortunately, discriminatory pay is far more commonplace than most would like to believe.

The recently passed Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act points to ongoing wage-related improprieties, and itself is only a small step in the right direction. An economics-minded person may ask themselves, “Is the current engineering shortage tied to wage market manipulation and price suppression?”

Wage suppression through collusion is just one obstacle that people must overcome as they navigate the complicated employment market. Wage suppression through self-imposed ignorance is both common and universally harmful.

In PandoDaily’s post, we read about Google’s not pursuing even the most desirable, highly-demanded engineers due to corrupt practices. If top-tier talent is facing employment market issues, then it’s not a reach to imagine that almost everyone could benefit from a better approach to employment market management.

In this post, we’ll examine the things you can do to mitigate the risks associated with obstacles like these, improving your position in the market.
